## Cult Coins Tokenomics 

strategy using Moonshot's "Launch, Lock & Earn" aims to deploy Cult Token while securing long-term rewards for creators and early supporters. The process begins with the deployment of Cult Token on Moonshot, followed by migration to Meteora, where liquidity pool tokens are distributed: 20% to the creator, 10% to Moonshot, and 70% to the top 50 holders. Meteoraâ€™s dynamic fee structure starts at 10% and reduces over time, incentivizing early participation. For example, a daily trading volume of $1M could yield $26,790 in earnings for a top holder on day one. Rewards can be claimed through the Meteora app, with frequent claims recommended to minimize losses due to token price fluctuations.

Additional mechanics include adjustable slippage, with the default set at 15%, and market cap calculations based on total supply multiplied by the token price. The minimum buy amount is set at 0.005 SOL to prevent spam, while the minimum sell amount is 0.001 SOL equivalent. The migration process typically takes 30 seconds to 2 minutes, during which trading on Moonshot is paused.

The structure encourages long-term holding over short-term selling, ensuring ongoing earnings aligned with the token's growth and success. This framework leverages Moonshot's features to support sustainable growth and aligned incentives for Cult Token stakeholders.
