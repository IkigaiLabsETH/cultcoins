## Cult Coins Tokenomics 

strategy using Moonshot's "Launch, Lock & Earn" aims to deploy Cult Token while securing long-term rewards for creators and early supporters. The process begins with the deployment of Cult Token on Moonshot, followed by migration to Meteora, where liquidity pool tokens are distributed: 20% to the creator, 10% to Moonshot, and 70% to the top 50 holders. Meteora’s dynamic fee structure starts at 10% and reduces over time, incentivizing early participation. For example, a daily trading volume of $1M could yield $26,790 in earnings for a top holder on day one. Rewards can be claimed through the Meteora app, with frequent claims recommended to minimize losses due to token price fluctuations.

Additional mechanics include adjustable slippage, with the default set at 15%, and market cap calculations based on total supply multiplied by the token price. The minimum buy amount is set at 0.005 SOL to prevent spam, while the minimum sell amount is 0.001 SOL equivalent. The migration process typically takes 30 seconds to 2 minutes, during which trading on Moonshot is paused.

The structure encourages long-term holding over short-term selling, ensuring ongoing earnings aligned with the token's growth and success. This framework leverages Moonshot's features to support sustainable growth and aligned incentives for Cult Token stakeholders.

## Moonshot / Dexscreener / Meteora

Our decision to build on Moonshot is driven by the platform’s superior integration, data offerings, and user experience, all of which align with our long-term vision. While the memecoin market is crowded and competitive, we believe that Moonshot's approach sets the stage for sustainable growth and success, making it the right foundation for our platform. Above all, the integration with Meteora

**Why We're Building on Moonshot**

When we initially set out to create a platform similar to Pump.fun, our goal was clear: enable users to easily launch and tradecult coins on Solana. But as we delved deeper into the ecosystem, we realized that there was a more strategic opportunity with Moonshot, the new memecoin launchpad by DEX Screener.

### **Vertical Integration and Enhanced Data Offerings**
Moonshot isn’t just another memecoin platform—it represents a significant step forward in the vertical integration of memecoin trading. While Pump.fun popularized the concept of quick, cheap token launches, it falls short in data offerings and user analytics, where many traders already rely on DEX Screener. By building on Moonshot, we leverage a more established and data-rich platform, ensuring our users have access to critical trading metrics directly within the ecosystem. This integration provides a seamless experience that Pump.fun simply can't match.

### **Superior User Experience**
Another compelling reason for our shift is the superior user experience (UX) that Moonshot offers. The interface is more polished, and the overall usability is miles ahead, which matters significantly when users are navigating a fast-paced trading environment. While Pump.fun has its strengths, especially in its social features like chat and livestreams, we believe that the cleaner, more intuitive design of Moonshot will attract and retain a broader audience—especially those who prioritize functionality and data over social engagement.

### **Market Position and Future Potential**
The memecoin market is evolving rapidly, and Moonshot positions itself as more than just a launchpad; it’s part of a larger trend recognizing memecoin trading as a legitimate retail business opportunity.
